## Intro
This document is the embryo of a Bioinformatics Lab for the Workshop on Genomics, Cesky Krumlov, Czechia (yes, the Czech Republic is now referred to as Czechia). 
For more information on the course in its entirety, please have a look at [The Workshop on Genomics 2018](http://evomics.org/workshops/workshop-on-genomics/2018-workshop-on-genomics-cesky-krumlov/)

The parts here are a mix of my personal views on the latest developments and future prospects where I believe that the field is heading. The idea is to give you an idea of how you can handle and process the sequence data that you recieve from the sequencer. Although some parts of the lab and certain tools may be specific to a particular sequencing technology or application, the overall philosophy on handling your sequencing data is the same.

OK, lets get to work! The lab will guide you through a number of important steps and considerations when working with sequence data.

### Datasets
Provide links and metadata for all datasets used in the exercises below.

##	Reproducibility
- Organising files in the project (UNIX hygiene)
- A few words on reproducibiliy (be kind to yourself and others)
- Git?
- Datasubmission, Storage vs backup
- Exercise 1
- References

## Quality control
- Think about your research question
- What type of data do you have and what do you expect to get from your sequence provider?
- Kmers
- Excercise 2 (MultiQC based)

## Trimming and Filtering
- When to trim and when not to
- Adapter removal
- Bar code issues
- Soft vs hard clipping 
- Removal of complete reads
- Merging overlapping pair-end reads (BBMap?)
- Exercise 3 (MultiQC based, compare with untrimmed data)

## Few last words on data handling
- Summary
- What is important for you and your fellow researchers?
- Rings in the water, inspire others!
